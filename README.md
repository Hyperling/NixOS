# My NixOS Configuration(s)
Configuration file and helper scripts for my NixOS setup.

Just startred researching NixOS at the end of August 2023 and seeing if it makes

## DISCLAIMERS
### THIS PROJECT IS A WORK IN PROGRESS

Currently still considered early alpha phase. Things work, but still have a ways
to go before the system is completely ready for "production".
